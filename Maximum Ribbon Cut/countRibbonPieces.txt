Given a number array to represent possible ribbon lengths and a total ribbon length ‘n,’ we need to find the maximum number of pieces that the ribbon can be cut into.

Example1
n: 5
Ribbon Lengths: {2,3,5}
Output: 2

Example2
n: 7
Ribbon Lengths: {2,3}
Output: 3

Example3
n: 13
Ribbon Lengths: {3,5,7}
Output: 3
