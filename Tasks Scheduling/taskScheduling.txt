There are ‘N’ tasks, labeled from ‘0’ to ‘N-1’. Each task can have some prerequisite tasks which need to be completed before it can be scheduled. Given the number of tasks and a list of prerequisite pairs, find out if it is possible to schedule all the tasks.

Example1
Input: Tasks=3, Prerequisites=[0, 1], [1, 2]
Output: true

Example2
Input: Tasks=3, Prerequisites=[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]
Output: false

Example3
Input: Tasks=6, Prerequisites=[2, 5], [0, 5], [0, 4], [1, 4], [3, 2], [1, 3]
Output: true
