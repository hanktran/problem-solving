Given an array of numbers and a number ‘K’, we need to remove ‘K’ numbers from the array such that we are left with maximum distinct numbers.

Example1
Input: [7, 3, 5, 8, 5, 3, 3], and K=2
Output: 3

Example2
Input: [3, 5, 12, 11, 12], and K=3
Output: 2

Example3
Input: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5], and K=2
Output: 3
