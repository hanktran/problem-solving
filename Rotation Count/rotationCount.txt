Given an array of numbers which is sorted in ascending order and is rotated ‘k’ times around a pivot, find ‘k’.

You can assume that the array does not have any duplicates.

Example 1
Input: [10, 15, 1, 3, 8]
Output: 2

Example 2
Input: [4, 5, 7, 9, 10, -1, 2]
Output: 5

Example 3
Input: [1, 3, 8, 10]
Output: 0
