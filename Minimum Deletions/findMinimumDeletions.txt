Given a number sequence, find the minimum number of elements that should be deleted to make the remaining sequence sorted.

Example1
Input: {4,2,3,6,10,1,12}
Output: 2
Explanation: We need to delete {4,1} to make the remaing sequence sorted {2,3,6,10,12}.

Example1
Input: {-4,10,3,7,15}
Output: 1
Explanation: We need to delete {10} to make the remaing sequence sorted {-4,3,7,15}.

Example1
Input: {3,2,1,0}
Output: 3
Explanation: Since the elements are in reverse order, we have to delete all except one to get a 
sorted sequence. Sorted sequences are {3}, {2}, {1}, and {0}
