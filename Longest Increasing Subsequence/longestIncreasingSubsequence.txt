Given a number sequence, find the length of its Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). In an increasing subsequence, all the elements are in increasing order (from lowest to highest).

Example1
Input: {4,2,3,6,10,1,12}
Output: 5
Explanation: The LIS is {2,3,6,10,12}.

Example2
Input: {-4,10,3,7,15}
Output: 4
Explanation: The LIS is {-4,3,7,15}.
