Given two sequences ‘s1’ and ‘s2’, write a method to find the length of the shortest sequence which has ‘s1’ and ‘s2’ as subsequences.

Example1
Input: s1: "abcf" s2:"bdcf" 
Output: 5
Explanation: The shortest common super-sequence (SCS) is "abdcf". 

Example2
Input: s1: "dynamic" s2:"programming" 
Output: 15
Explanation: The SCS is "dynprogrammicng".
