Given a sequence, find the length of its Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS). In a palindromic subsequence, elements read the same backward and forward.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example1
Input: "abdbca"
Output: 5

Example2
Input: = "cddpd"
Output: 3

Example3
Input: = "pqr"
Output: 1
