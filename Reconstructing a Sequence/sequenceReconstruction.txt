Given a sequence originalSeq and an array of sequences, write a method to find if originalSeq can be uniquely reconstructed from the array of sequences.

Unique reconstruction means that we need to find if originalSeq is the only sequence such that all sequences in the array are subsequences of it.

Example1
Input: originalSeq: [1, 2, 3, 4], seqs: [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
Output: true

Example2
Input: originalSeq: [1, 2, 3, 4], seqs: [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4]]
Output: false

Example3
Input: originalSeq: [3, 1, 4, 2, 5], seqs: [[3, 1, 5], [1, 4, 2, 5]]
Output: true
