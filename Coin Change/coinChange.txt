Given a number array to represent different coin denominations and a total amount ‘T’, we need to find all the different ways to make a change for ‘T’ with the given coin denominations. We can assume an infinite supply of coins, therefore, each coin can be chosen multiple times.

Example1
Denominations: {1,2,3}
Total amount: 5
Output: 5
