There are n houses built in a line. A thief wants to steal the maximum possible money from these houses. The only restriction the thief has is that he canâ€™t steal from two consecutive houses, as that would alert the security system. How should the thief maximize his stealing?

Given a number array representing the wealth of n houses, determine the maximum amount of money the thief can steal without alerting the security system.

Example1
Input: {2, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 4}
Output: 15

Example2
Input: {2, 10, 14, 8, 1}
Output: 18
