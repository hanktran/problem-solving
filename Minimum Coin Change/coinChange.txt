Given a number array to represent different coin denominations and a total amount ‘T’, we need to find the minimum number of coins needed to make a change for ‘T’. We can assume an infinite supply of coins, therefore, each coin can be chosen multiple times.

Example1
Denominations: {1,2,3}
Total amount: 5
Output: 2

Example2
Denominations: {1,2,3}
Total amount: 11
Output: 4
