Given two strings ‘s1’ and ‘s2’, find the length of the longest subsequence which is common in both the strings.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example1
Input: s1 = "abdca"
       s2 = "cbda"
Output: 3

Example2
Input: s1 = "passport"
       s2 = "ppsspt"
Output: 5
