Given a set of positive numbers (non zero) and a target sum ‘S’. Each number should be assigned either a ‘+’ or ‘-’ sign. We need to find out total ways to assign symbols to make the sum of numbers equal to target ‘S’.

Example1
Input: {1, 1, 2, 3}, S=1
Output: 3

Example2
Input: {1, 2, 7, 1}, S=9
Output: 2
