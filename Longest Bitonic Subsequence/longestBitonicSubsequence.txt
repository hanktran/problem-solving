Given a number sequence, find the length of its Longest Bitonic Subsequence (LBS). A subsequence is considered bitonic if it is monotonically increasing and then monotonically decreasing.

Example1
Input: {4,2,3,6,10,1,12}
Output: 5
Explanation: The LBS is {2,3,6,10,1}.

Example2
Input: {4,2,5,9,7,6,10,3,1}
Output: 7
Explanation: The LBS is {4,5,9,7,6,3,1}.
