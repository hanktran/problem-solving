Given a staircase with ‘n’ steps and an array of ‘n’ numbers representing the fee that you have to pay if you take the step. Implement a method to calculate the minimum fee required to reach the top of the staircase (beyond the top-most step). At every step, you have an option to take either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps. You should assume that you are standing at the first step.

Example1
Number of stairs (n) : 6
Fee: {1,2,5,2,1,2}
Output: 3

Example2
Number of stairs (n): 4
Fee: {2,3,4,5}
Output: 5
