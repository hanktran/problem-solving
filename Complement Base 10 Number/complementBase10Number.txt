Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation, for example, 8 can be represented as “1000” in binary and 7 as “0111” in binary.

The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary that we get when we change every 1 to a 0 and every 0 to a 1. For example, the binary complement of “1010” is “0101”.

For a given positive number N in base-10, return the complement of its binary representation as a base-10 integer.

Example 1
Input: 8
Output: 7

Example 2
Input: 10
Output: 5
