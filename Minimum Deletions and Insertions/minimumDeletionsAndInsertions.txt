Given strings s1 and s2, we need to transform s1 into s2 by deleting and inserting characters. Write a function to calculate the count of the minimum number of deletion and insertion operations.

Example1
Input: s1 = "abc"
       s2 = "fbc"
Output: 1 deletion and 1 insertion.

Example2
Input: s1 = "abdca"
       s2 = "cbda"
Output: 2 deletions and 1 insertion.

Example3
Input: s1 = "passport"
       s2 = "ppsspt"
Output: 3 deletions and 1 insertion.
