Given a stair with ‘n’ steps, implement a method to count how many possible ways are there to reach the top of the staircase, given that, at every step you can either take 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps.

Example1
Number of stairs (n) : 3
Number of ways = 4

Example2
Number of stairs (n) : 4
Number of ways = 7
